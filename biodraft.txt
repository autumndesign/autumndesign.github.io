My name is Autumn and I'm an artist born and raised in Pocahontas, AR. 
I currently attend BRTC in Pocahontas and next semester I'm transferring 
to ASU to pursue a degree in Graphic Design. I'm also super interested
in web design and I'm considering a minor in marketing. 

My favorite mediums are oil paint and graphite. I've been oil painting 
since I was 10 years old, and sketching as long as I can remember.
I can't even forget the good old days when I'd scribble with a 
reckless abandon! My big sister, Andrea, was a huge inspiration for me.
When we were children, she loved to draw aswell and I wanted to be 
like her. So thank you for that, big sister.

I also am exploring photography. Please check out my website

if you are interested!

Besides art, I really enjoy cooking, rock music, scifi-TV shows, reading, 
and spending time with my friends and family. If I'm not working at my
part-time job or at school, you can usually find me practicing one
of my hobbies or working on my web design skills. 

Please, get comfortable, take your time, and explore my little website!
I am working on producing more art and other creations 
to share with you and the rest of the world.
